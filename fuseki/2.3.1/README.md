## entrypoint

The [entrypoint](entrypoint.sh) is used to evaluate any environment variables that may have been set at run time, such as `${DEBUG_PORT}`.

## Example Usage

#### Starting

Logs displayed to the console, allows container to be killed using CTRL-C.

`$ docker run -ti emetsger/apix-fuseki:2.3.1`

#### Debugging

Enable Java remote debugging on `${DEBUG_PORT}`

`$ docker run -ti -e DEBUG emetsger/apix-fuseki:2.3.1`

#### Display logs

Logs are by default echoed out to the console.  However, if you're in a different shell window and want to see them:

`$ docker logs <container name>`

#### Obtain a shell

To obtain a shell in a running container, first [start the container](#starting), and then in another shell window run:

`$ docker exec -ti <container name> /bin/bash`

Alternately, to simply shell into a non-existent container, override the entrypoint:

`$ docker run -ti --entrypoint=/bin/bash emetsger/apix-fuseki:2.3.1`
